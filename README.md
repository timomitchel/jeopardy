# Jeopardy Data

This repository is intended to provide a sorted list of the most frequent **categories** and **answers** that have appeared on the Jeopardy game show.

You can run the `jep.rb` file in order to see the two 2-D arrays sorted in descending order and saved to their respective variable names.

The JSON data was downloaded from: [Jeopardy Data as JSON](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwT5wj_P7BKXb2hfM3d2RHU1ckE/view "Jeopardy Data")

The original reddit post is here: [reddit jeopardy data](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/)

I recommend using **pry** to inspect.

Enjoy!
